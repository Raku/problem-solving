Raku CoC Incident Response Guide
================================

This document describes the Raku Code of Conduct enforcement
procedures in general terms but is not intended to be binding or to
create any rights; in all cases, ensuring that the Raku community is
welcoming, inclusive, safe, and enjoyable for all ("-Ofun") should
take priority over strictly following the procedures described below.

This guide is not legal advice.

Before Taking Action
====================

The CoC is enforced by the Raku Community Affairs Team (currently
comprised of the members of the Raku Steering Council).

When the CAT receives a report of a CoC violation, any members who are
the subject of the report or who have an actual or apparent conflict
of interest shall immediately be recused and will neither participate
in further actions nor access information about the report or the
CAT's response.

Barring extraordinary circumstances, the CAT will act on all reports
within 72 hours of first receiving the report.  The CAT will act by
majority vote and, if practicable, should hold a synchronous meeting
(e.g., a video call) with at least 3 attendees to vote on its action.
However, due to the importance of promptly responding to reports, the
CAT may also act via asynchronous discussion and voting (e.g., over
email).  If it does so, it may set a deadline after which failure to
cast an explicit vote will be treated as an abstention.

Investigating the Incident
--------------------------

In some cases (especially those involving in-person conduct), the CAT
may investigate the incident, such as by having one or more members
speak with the reporter, the alleged violator, or others present at
the incident.  In other cases (especially those where a violation was
recorded, such as in an IRC log or recorded conference presentation),
no such investigation will be necessary.

When considering alleged violations, the CAT should bear in mind that it
lacks the resources of the formal legal system and that the actions it
takes inflict far less harm than those taken by the legal system.
Accordingly, the CAT should not attempt to determine whether a violation
has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, it should ask what
action best promotes an -Ofun community based on the facts as they
appear.

Similarly, the lower severity of the remedies available to the CAT mean
that alleged violators need not receive any of the procedural
protections criminal defendants are entitled to, such as the right to
speak in their defense.  Accordingly, it is especially important that
the CAT remember that determining guilt and assigning punishment are
_not_ within its purview; the CAT's only job is to make decisions that
will make the Raku community as -Ofun as possible.

Additionally, the CAT should remember that the violator's intent
(which may be impossible to accurately determine) is generally not
relevant; instead, the CAT should focus on the impact the incident
had, and the impact that other, similar events could be expected to
have.

If its investigations into an incident reveal other CoC violations
that were not reported (e.g., an IRC argument in which multiple people
engaged in personal attacks but only one was reported), the CAT should
also evaluate those violations and take appropriate actions.

Responding to the Incident
==========================

After reviewing the incident, the CAT should determine what action to
take in response.  When making this determination, the CAT should
consult records of previous violations, both to see whether the violator
has a history of poor behavior and to ensure that similar violations
receive proportional responses.

Because CoC violations by members of the Raku Steering Council and
others in positions of trust or authority within the Raku community are
especially harmful, these individuals are appropriately held to an even
higher standard than other community members.  The CAT should consider
this higher standard when deciding what action to take when someone in
that group has violated the CoC.

Allowed Responses
-----------------

The CAT can respond to reports with any of the following actions or with
any other action it deems appropriate:

* Determining that the conduct did not violate the CoC or that no action
  is needed.
* Determining that the incident requires additional investigation.
* Speaking to the violator informally.
* Editing or redacting media (such as the video of a conference talk)
  that contains the violation. 
* Removing media that contains the violation.
* Officially warning the violator.
* Temporarily banning the violator from one or more Raku community
  spaces.
* Publicly reprimanding the violator.
* Permanently banning the violator from one or more Raku community
  spaces.
* Recommending that the Raku Steering Council eject the violator from the
  Raku core team.
* Recommending that the Raku Steering Council eject the violator from the
  Raku core team and permanently banning them from the Raku community.

Disallowed Responses
--------------------

While the CAT can take appropriate actions other than those listed
above, it should _not_ take any of the following inappropriate actions:

* Requiring the violator to apologize (voluntary apologies are sometimes
  helpful; coerced apologies never are).
* Asking or requiring the target of the violation to decide on or
  approve the action (this shifts blame to the target; the decision is
  the CAT's responsibility).
* Requiring the violator to avoid the target (this is logistically
  unworkable without unfairly burdening the target's privacy and invites
  future conflict).
* Assigning someone to "chaperone" or otherwise supervise the violator
  (this is unfair and logistically unworkable; if the CAT is concerned
  enough about future violations to consider this response, it should
  ban the violator instead).

A Note on Mediation
-------------------

The CAT should not require mediation, nor should it recommend mediation
as an action it takes in response to a CoC violation.  This is because
violating the CoC is an action that harms the entire Raku community;
reframing the CoC violation as an interpersonal conflict is
inappropriate and suggests that the target of the violation is partly or
equally responsible for the violation.  This is incorrect: it is
perfectly possible for two people to dislike each other without either
violating the CoC.

However, it is equally the case that continued interpersonal conflict or
animosity could lead to future CoC violations and, even if it doesn't,
makes the Raku community less -Ofun.  Thus, if the CAT identifies an
underlying interpersonal conflict or cross-cultural misunderstanding, it
can be appropriate for the CAT to offer mediation _after and separate
from_ its resolution of the violation.  If the CAT offers mediation, it
should state clearly that mediation is not required and is not a
response that the CAT is taking based on the CoC violation but rather is
a service the CAT is offering to help resolve an underlying
interpersonal or cross-cultural issue.  Mediation should _never_ be
offered if the violation is extremely serious (e.g., harassment).

After Taking Action
===================

In all cases, the CAT will inform the reporter how the report was
resolved and may inform others who witnessed the incident.  When
deciding whom to inform, the CAT should keep in mind that, if a
bystander is not informed that action was taken based on a CoC
violation, they may conclude that the Raku community permits behavior
of the sort they witnessed.

The CAT will preserve records of the incident including, at a minimum,
the initial report and a record of any action that was taken (including
informal conversations with the violator).  The CAT will ensure that
these records are accessible to the CAT when addressing future reports
but are not accessible to non-members.

At least annually, the CAT will publish a summary of all reported
incidents and any actions taken in response to those incidents; it may
publish reports (either of multiple actions or a single action) more
frequently based on their number or severity.  Except in cases where
naming the violator is essential to the action (e.g., a public
reprimand), the CAT will endeavor not to name violators and will not
name reporters.  However, the nature of an incident may make the
identity of one or both parties obvious (for example, if the incident
occurred in a publicly logged IRC channel).

When summarizing an incident, the CAT should avoid going into more
detail than necessary to fairly inform the community of the incident.
Additionally, the CAT should recall that the identity of any party may
become known even if that party isn't named in the summary, and the CAT
should be especially careful to avoid descriptions of the event that
risk creating misleading impressions of the violation's severity.  If
factual disputes about the incident exist, the CAT should avoid creating
the impression of greater certainty about the facts than exists.  If a
violator cannot be identified, then the incident summary should state
what action the CAT would have taken if the violator had been
identified.

The following incident description from the [Conference in the Cloud
2020 SoC Transparency
Report](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/cic-2020-soc-transparency-report)
provides an example of the appropriate level of detail:

> Slides for a talk were reported as containing inappropriate
> material. The CAT reviewed the recording of the talk and agreed that
> this was the case. The CAT talked with the speaker, explaining the
> issue and the consequences. The speaker was given a final warning.

Whenever the CAT publishes a summary of any incidents or otherwise
communicates publicly, it shall establish an appropriate venue for
discussion (e.g., a GitHub issue) and shall request that all discussion
about the incidents be limited to that venue or sent directly to the CAT
via email.  It shall also state that discussion of the incident or
debate about the appropriate response to it is off topic in all other
Raku spaces and may itself be a CoC violation.

(The reason for this restriction is that defenses of violations can
often do more to make a community non-inclusive than the initial
violation itself, especially when those debates occur in spaces that are
impractical for community members to avoid (such as #raku).  It is
essential that there be a space for the community to debate and
criticize the CAT's actions, but it's also essential that this space be
an opt-in one.)

If community discussion reveals significant confusion or
misunderstanding about a factual issue, the CAT may issue _one_ follow
up communication about the incident.  When doing so, it should keep the
following rules (from [How to Respond to Code of Conduct
Reports](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/)) in
mind:

* Do not try to persuade people who strongly disagree with you
* Wait to see how people react to the initial announcement
* If necessary, post one follow-up to clarify any genuine
  misunderstandings
* Refuse to provide more details about the incident or its handling
* Refuse to engage in one-on-one arguments, online or in person
* Redirect any community-wide discussions into smaller venues

Regardless of whether the CAT issues a follow-up communication, it must
not edit the original communication in any way, except that it may
optionally add a single clearly labeled edit linking to the follow-up
communication.

For additional guidance (including guidance on handling more severe
incidents), the CAT may refer to [How to Respond to Code of Conduct
Reports](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/).  If
doing so would be helpful, the CAT may also consult with the Community
Affairs Team or Legal Committee at Yet Another Society or with other
outside advisors.
