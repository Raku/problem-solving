Raku Code of Conduct
====================

The Raku community is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive,
safe, and enjoyable environment for everyone.  In fact, we have a term
for a "welcoming, inclusive, safe, and enjoyable for all": we say that
the Raku community should be "optimized for fun" – or, in short form,
"-Ofun".  Using that terminology, we are committed to ensuring that the
Raku community is -Ofun for everyone, regardless of level of experience,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
neurodiversity, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

Many people have eloquently described the -Ofun community culture to
which we aspire.  In the interest of clarity and concision, this
document does not do so; instead, it provides a short, readable list of
unacceptable behaviors so that we're all on the same page about the
ground rules in our particular community.

The purpose of this CoC is _exclusively_ to ensure that the Raku
community is -Ofun (welcoming, inclusive, safe, and enjoyable for all).
This CoC is not designed to punish wrongdoers, mediate arguments, or
improve the morality of community members.  Those goals may be worthy
but are outside the scope of this document.

Unacceptable Behaviors
======================

The following behaviors, in no particular order, are unacceptable and
violate the Code of Conduct.

* Using sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise
  discriminatory language (including repeated/deliberate misgendering or
  deadnaming).
* Using insults, profanity targeting a person, personal or political
  attacks, or other gratuitously hurtful language (if in doubt,
  criticize ideas or behavior instead of people).
* Repeatedly involving someone in a conversation or topic (for example,
  by sending them emails or chat notifications) despite their
  objection.
* Continuing or repeatedly starting a conversation in an inappropriate
  venue (for example, debating the merits of a Code of Conduct violation
  in the general #raku IRC channel rather than in the appropriate GitHub
  issue or repeated off-topic conversations in #raku-dev).
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or graphically violent images
  or using sexually explicit language or excessive profanity.
* Making inappropriate sexual advances.
* Stalking (online or in person) or inappropriate photography/recording.
* Revealing, or threatening to reveal, someone's contact information or
  other non-public data ("doxing") or sharing private content, such as
  non-public emails or channel history from unlogged IRC channels,
  without consent.
* Any public or private harassment.
* Refusing to agree to follow the existing CoC (arguing that the CoC
  should be changed is fine when done in an appropriate venue; refusing
  to follow the exiting CoC is not).
* Falsely reporting a CoC violation in bad faith.

Non Defenses
============

The following "justifications" do _not_ excuse violating the Code of
Conduct:

* "They started it": When someone violates the CoC, speaking to them
  about their behavior or reporting the behavior may be appropriate,
  depending on the circumstances.  However, no circumstances justify
  responding in a way that itself violates the CoC.  It is entirely
  possible for multiple people in a conversation to violate the CoC;
  one person's CoC violations in no way offset the other's.
* "I didn't mean to": Intent may be relevant to determining the
  _severity_ of a CoC violation – malicious intent certainly makes
  harmful conduct worse.  But intent is typically _not_ relevant to
  determining whether conduct violates the CoC.  Instead, whether
  behavior violates the CoC is determined entirely by the impact that
  behavior had (and could be reasonably expected to have had).  Good
  intent does not excuse harmful impact.
* "It's free speech": A huge number of statements are both lawful and
  totally unwelcome in the Raku community; speech laws of any
  jurisdiction are entirely irrelevant to determining whether particular
  conduct violates the CoC.
* "It's just a tone issue": In some communities, ideas are the only
  thing that matters – if the substance of an idea is correct, then the
  way that idea is expressed is irrelevant.  The Raku community is not
  like that.  In the Raku community, tone matters: forceful criticism of
  someone's ideas or behavior can be perfectly in keeping with the CoC
  if expressed one way; the same ideas, expressed as a personal attack,
  would violate the CoC.
* "That doesn't count because it was on a personal blog": As explained
  below, personal blogs, social media profiles, and similar spaces are
  _not_ covered by the CoC; however, the Raku community can still respond
  to content or behavior in those spaces if that content/behavior makes
  complying with the CoC in Raku spaces unlikely or impossible.  This is
  because enforcing the CoC is never a punitive act; it is always about
  ensuring that the Raku community is -Ofun.  For instance, the Raku
  community would be neither inclusive nor enjoyable if it welcomed
  people who post racist screeds to their personal sites, no matter how
  assiduously they attempted to separate those statements from their
  Raku activities.
* "You'll never prove it": The CoC is not a code of law, and enforcing
  it does not require proving that any particular violation definitely
  took place (much less proving it by the standards of a criminal
  court).  All it requires is that the response to an incident help make
  the Raku community -Ofun.

Covered Spaces
==============

This CoC applies to the #raku, #raku-dev, and #moarvm IRC channels; the
GitHub repositories under the Raku, Rakudo, and MoarVM organizations;
the perl6/Raku mailing lists; the Raku Discord channel; the r/rakulang
subreddit; posts to Rakudo Weekly News; blogs posted to Planet Raku; and
any other digital spaces Raku may establish.  It also applies to all
official Raku conferences and events, physical or digital.

Modification
============
The Raku Steering Council may revise this CoC by majority vote.  Any 
revisions will have purely prospective effect.

Enforcement
===========

The CoC will be enforced by the Community Affairs Team (excluding any
recused members) as described in the [CoC Incident Response
Guide](./coc_incident_response_guide.md).  The CAT will make every
effort to respond within 72 hours of receiving a report; if a violation
occurred, the CAT may respond by a range of actions from informally
discussing the incident with the violator to permanently banning the
violator from Raku community spaces and recommending that the Raku
Steering Council eject them from the core team.  Please see the [CoC
Incident Response
Guide](./coc_incident_response_guide.md#allowed-responses) for details.

Reporting Violations
====================

If you were subject to or witnessed a CoC violation, you should report
it to CAT@raku.org.  Alternatively, you can report a violation to any
member of the CAT, who will forward it to all non-recused members of the
CAT.  Please be aware that, while the CAT will make all reasonable
efforts not to disclose the identity of individuals who report
violations, it cannot guarantee reporter anonymity nor do reporters have
a way to lessen or otherwise alter the action the CAT takes based on a
report.
