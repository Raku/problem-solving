# Deprecating 

This document provides a solution to [issue 330](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/330).

# Change to redirect

- Change the configuration of the https://modules.raku.org website so that all known (deep-)links to it, will redirect to a proper location on the https://raku.land website.
- Switch off any harvesting that the https://modules.raku.org backend was doing to be able to provide the information on the website.
- Archive the https://github.com/Raku/modules.raku.org repository.
